# Region-Of-Interest-Based-Encryption-Of-Biomedical-Ultrasonic-Image

I worked to extract  Region-Of-Interest of bio medical image and encrypt it using three assymetrical encryption algorithms rsa, lea, elgamal.Later compared the computational times required for encryption of entire image and its respective region of interest and drwan to conclusion that Region of interest takes less compuataional times.
